One of the components of this course has a focus on scientific communication. Specifically, communicating with the scientific community about an epidemiological study that has been designed to answer a particular health research question and appropriately interpreting the study results. Students write a research article suitable for submission to an academic peer-reviewed health journal for publication. However, a general challenge of teaching scientific communication is that most of the associated teaching materials and references are either overly general (not discipline-specific, do not take into account applications to healthcare), or not openly accessible (expensive textbooks). Also, SPPH students have varying academic backgrounds, and many are not familiar with new scientific writing collaboration tools that are helpful for managing collaborative projects and can aid in conducting reproducible research. This OER project will allow us to make the course content open to other UBC health researchers who struggle with scientific writing and introduce them to tools that will help them manage collaborative group research projects. The project aims to create and share openly accessible high-quality OER content through a step-by-step educational guide on how to write scientific articles for peer-reviewed journals, with a specific focus on communicating with the health research community. Specific topics include: Scientific writing basics, components of a good research question Writing the ‘Introduction’ section, identifying a gap in the literature Writing the ‘Methods’ section, describing the data sources/collection, study design, and statistical analysis Presenting tables and figures, and writing the ‘Results’ section Writing the ‘Discussion’ section, interpreting results, stating the implications, strengths and limitations of the study, and future research Introducing tools for managing collaborative scientific writing projects and reproducible research (e.g., RMarkdown, GitHub). Project Goals Background: The principal applicant is teaching a UBC course (SPPH 504-007). In this course, one of the components is the communication of scientific research findings through scientific writing. The specific goals are stated below. Goals: The goals of the project are to (1) create and update course content and materials as open educational resources (OERs), and (2) openly share a step-by-step guide (i.e., written OER content, primarily text) on how to write scientific articles for peer-reviewed journals (in the “IMRaD” format; structured in the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). (3) Introduce some cutting-edge tools helpful for managing collaborative scientific writing projects and conducting reproducible research (e.g., RMarkdown, GitHub). Implication: One obvious implication is increased accessibility to students. Currently, the course SPPH 504-007 is restricted to SPPH Ph.D. students. If this rapid grant project is successful, this content will be openly accessible and will potentially help health researchers across campus interested in publishing manuscripts on their health data research. Examples of people who will directly benefit from this open access project include: SPPH master’s students (e.g., MSc, MPH, MHA, who cannot currently register for this course), researchers from all the Departments in the UBC Faculty of Medicine, and any other Departments with researchers that conduct healthcare and biomedical data analysis and research. Format: Content will primarily be text, that will be placed on an openly accessible GitHub page. Where necessary, tables, pictures and multi-media will be included. Short videos will be embedded to summarize important sections of the content. Version history Initial outlines were created for SPPH 504-007 during 2018-2021. In 2021, though OER Fund Rapid Innovation Grant and WorkLearn program, a GRA was hired to convert the outlines to drafts, that were revised and updated by other contributors.

The introduction section sets the stage for the entire paper and introduces the topic of interest to the audience. This first section provides a broad context of the issue under investigation, summarizes what is known and unknown, and tries to convince the readers that this particular study will be a valuable addition to current knowledge. There are several guidelines suggesting how to best structure the introduction section for a research paper (Cals and Kotz 2013a; Bahadoran et al. 2018; Heard 2016, 84–88). Typically, a well-written introduction section will contain broader background information on the topic, a summary of key existing knowledge relevant to the specific problem, the gap in the current knowledge (rationale), and the research question and/or the hypothesis. Though not essential, some authors may opt to briefly describe the study design and methods. 2.1 Funnel shape To better organize the main components of the introduction, it may be useful to build an outline or a skeleton of the section. One approach could be adopting a “funnel shape” or an inverted pyramid shape to organize the components. Based on the funnel shape, the introduction section has five key elements going from broad to narrow: big picture, what is known, what is unknown, research question and methods/design (see Figure 1). Figure 2.1: The typical funnel shape of an Introduction section. Big picture: the introduction starts with the big picture, represented by the broad opening of the funnel shape. The big picture introduces the general context of the research area and provides an overview of “why this topic or issue is important.” For a research paper in population and public health, it is a good idea to present the broader background information on the health-related topic. This may include the magnitude of the problem and/or the burden of disease (e.g., incidence, prevalence or cost). The big picture should provide the audience with an understanding of the study outcome or explanatory variable from a public health perspective. What is known: from the big picture, the author narrows down to a more specific research area under investigation. This part should outline the existing knowledge of the research area by providing a summary of the evidence, including the landmark and recent studies. This summary should cite the most current and comprehensive knowledge on the subject. Remember that the evidence cited should be directly relevant to your specific study and inform your research question. These summaries should focus on the particular exposure or disease of interest (e.g., intervention or outcome elements of the PICOT framework) (Thabane et al. 2009). What is unknown: as the funnel further narrows, this part should present a synthesis of the reasons why the issue is important (in the big picture), what is already known, and what is unknown, to convince the audience that there is a need to conduct your specific study. This part can include the gaps in current knowledge, any inconsistencies in the literature, gaps in the methodology or the need for different or better methodology. When describing what is unknown, the author should highlight the importance of conducting the present study and persuade the readers that this analysis was needed (rationale). Who would likely benefit from this study should also be highlighted. For example, if there is a previous study that answered the same research question, a clear and compelling argument on the need for the updated study should be included. Research question: following the identification of the gap in current knowledge, this part outlines the specific purpose of the study. It should include the study objective and/or hypothesis that will address the identified gap in current knowledge. Methods/design: as the last stage of the funnel, this part can briefly introduce the approach used to answer the research question. This can include the study design or methods, however, a brief summary is sufficient as the methodological approach will be described in depth in the methods section. 2.2 Examples 2.2.1 Example 1 The first example is taken from Nisingizwe et al. (2020). You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about the association between perceived barriers to health care access and inadequate antenatal care visits (Nisingizwe et al. 2020) Elements Location in the introduction section Comments Big picture 1st paragraph (“Maternal and neonatal mortality …”) Authors introduce the public health problem of interest, maternal and neonatal mortality, by presenting the magnitude of the problem and the burden of disease. This paragraph highlights the importance of the public health problem. What is known 2nd paragraph (“Timely and frequency of ANC …”) The authors describe the more specific research area: the relationship between receiving adequate antenatal care (ANC) and barriers to healthcare. 3rd paragraph (“However, the country’ maternal and neonatal death rates …”) The authors provide a summary of the existing knowledge relevant to the study that informs the research question. What is unknown 4th paragraph (“To date, there is a paucity …”) The authors present what is unknown: the relationship between perceived barriers to health care and inadequate ANC visits in Rwanda. In addition, they identify previous studies and the gaps in the current knowledge. The clear identification of a research gap supports the stated rationale for conducting this particular study. Research question 4th paragraph (“Therefore, this study aims …”) Following the identification of the gap in current knowledge, the authors present the specific purpose of the study. 5th paragraph (“We hypothesized that …”) The authors present the hypothesis for the research question. 5th paragraph (“This study will contribute to …”) the authors include a brief summary of the key study implications to convince the audience that this research paper will add value to the field of study. Methods/design The authors have not included a specific section summarizing the methodological approach used in the study to answer the research question. However, in the 4th paragraph, they indicated that the study will use a “country representative sample” from “2015 DHS data.” 2.2.2 Example 2 The second example is taken from Basham and Karim (2019). You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about prevalence of multimorbidity in northern vs. southern Canada (Basham and Karim 2019) Elements Location in the introduction section Comments Big picture 1st paragraph (“Multimorbidity is common among …”) The public health problem of interest, multimorbidity, is introduced along with the magnitude of the problem and the burden of disease. What is known and unknown 2nd paragraph (“Northern Canada, which …”) and 3rd paragraph (“The equivocacy of findings …”) The more specific research area, multimorbidity in Canadian provinces and territories, is contextualized. The authors provide a summary of relevant previous studies and highlight the gaps within these studies. The synthesis of the “big picture,” “what is known” and “what is unknown” elements supports the rationale for this particular study. Research question 3rd paragraph (“The primary aim of this study …”) Once the need for this particular study is identified, the authors present the specific research question and the hypothesis. Methods/design 3rd paragraph (“This study describes multimorbidity …”) The authors briefly mention the methodological approach used in the study. Through these 2 examples, we have looked at the key elements of an introduction section of a scientific article in population and public health research. The introduction section provides the general context of the topic (big picture), the narrower research area and what is known, the gap in the existing knowledge, the specific purpose of the study and a summary of the methods and design. 2.2.3 Importance of a ‘hook’ As the author and researcher, you have the knowledge of the “whole story” of your study from start to end. Hence, you can write the introduction strategically. The introduction section introduces the public health problem to the audience and tries to capture their interest to continue reading. In a newspaper or magazine article, the writer aims to grab the readers’ attention with a “hook” at the beginning. In a scientific article, although you don’t necessarily want to give out all the findings and study implications initially, you should utilize the introduction section to incite the readers’ and reviewers’ interest. By clearly outlining the key components, the introduction section should convince the audience that the population/public health issue under investigation is critical to address and that your particular study is novel and valuable. 2.3 Common pitfalls Common pitfalls in the introduction section include incomplete, inaccurate or outdated reviews of the literature on the topic. For example, including literature that is tangentially related or within the same field but not directly related to the problem, may result in an incomplete or confusing review of the background knowledge. Including inadequate, incomplete or outdated information may result in the rejection of the paper. Not adequately explaining the importance or the relevance of the current knowledge in relation to the study aims is another pitfall. This can lead to an introduction section that is less effective in communicating the relevancy and novelty of your study. 2.4 Tips Arguably, incorporating clear study aim(s) and rationales for the study objectives are the most important aspects of the introduction section. (i) Aims should be clearly articulated, and the design of the study should be planned accordingly. (ii) Take time to think about the justification of the current study. Provide only the key references that are needed to describe the background knowledge, as well as what is known and unknown about the topic of interest. Including an excessive amount of literature in the introduction can be distracting. Be mindful that you will have an opportunity to contextualize your research in the literature by comparing your findings with other studies in the Discussion section. The introduction should be focused on setting the tone for what is coming next. A lengthy introduction can also make the readers lose interest. A general suggestion is that the introduction section should be about 10-15% of the whole paper (Cals and Kotz 2013a). If you already have a general idea of the journals that you would like to submit your article to, the introduction can be tailored to the audience of the target journal. For example, if you are interested in submitting to journals with a heavier focus on methodology or epidemiology, you may want to highlight the novelties in the design or methods. If you are interested in submitting to clinician-focused or subject-specific journals, you may emphasize the clinical or public health implications of the study.

The purpose of the methods section is to provide a comprehensive picture of the methodological approach of the study in a straightforward and transparent manner. Broadly, the methods section should allow the readers to understand the dataset under consideration and the analytical steps undertaken in the study, and give a sense of reproducibility of the study (Annesley 2010; Kotz and Cals 2013a). 3.1 The “Bridge” Following the introduction section, the methods section connects the previously developed research question to the results section and equips the readers with all methodological details necessary to interpret the findings that will be presented in the next section. As such, the methods section is the “bridge” between the introduction and the results section. Typically, the main elements of a methods section are: study design and data collection; setting, analytic sample and variables; data and statistical analysis. Furthermore, breaking the methods section into sub-sections can be a helpful way to present the methodological approach in an organized fashion. The main elements of the methods section can be presented as sub-sections. Statement of study design and data collection: the study design (e.g. cohort study, cross-sectional study, etc) and other key elements of the study design should be mentioned early in the methods. The data source(s) and how data was collected should be detailed. Sampling strategy: for cross-sectional studies, it is recommended to describe the sampling design for the data source. Setting, analytic sample and variables: if relevant, the setting, locations and timeframe (e.g. recruitment, follow-up, data collection) can be described. For the analytic sample, how it was obtained from the target population should be clearly described, including inclusion and exclusion criteria. The key outcome and explanatory variables should be defined, including case definitions or algorithms. You can also present the details of methods of measurement or assessment if they are relevant, or if they are derived from other variables or measures. It is important to identify which covariates were included and why they were included or not included (variable selection). For the study population, if there are any differences between people who were included in the study population compared to those who were excluded from the source population, these differences should be described. Ethics approval: a statement about ethics approval from a research ethics board or other ethical considerations should be included. Data/statistical analysis: all statistical methods used for descriptive and inferential analyses should be described, including the methods used to control for confounding. If you have conducted sensitivity analyses, these should be described. The methods section should contain descriptions of statistical approach used for all findings presented in the results section. In general, the statistical program or software and the packages used are also stated in this section. When writing a scientific paper in epidemiology or in population and public health, the STROBE checklist (Von Elm et al. 2007) can be a helpful tool to ensure that you are reporting all necessary components in the methods section. Below we will have a look at two examples of papers presenting survey-based analysis with the STROBE checklist. 3.2 Examples 3.2.1 Example 1 This example is taken from Nikiforuk et al. (2021), which was based on the NHANES data. You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about chronic hepatitis C infection and monocyte-to-platelet ratio (Nikiforuk et al. 2021) Elements Location in the methods section Comments Study design The sub-section titled “data, design and study population” The authors outline briefly this was a cross-sectional study. Setting The sub-section titled “data, design and study population” The data source for the study, NHANES, is described including the target population, location, timeframe and sampling design. Participants The second paragraph of the sub-section titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The authors describe how the analytic dataset was created from the data source. Exclusion criteria is also included. Figure 1 in the paper illustrates who were excluded at each stage and helps readers to understand potential sources of selection bias and how these might affect the generalizability. Variables The first and second paragraphs of the sub-section titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The exposure and outcome variables of interest are clearly defined, including the explanation of how the outcome variable “monocyte-to-platelet ratio” was derived from two variables, complete blood count measures of monocyte count and platelet count. The authors include an additional file for more detailed description. The authors also provide the justification of how covariates were identified, with a directed acyclic graph included as an additional file. Data sources/measurement The sub-sections titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The authors provide information on how the key variables were measured, and further provide a reference for additional information on the data source, NHANES. Bias Throughout the sub-section titled “statistical analysis” The authors described all methods applied to adjust for any potential confounding, such as in the sub-section “transformation of the monocyte-to-platelet ratio” and other methods including missing data and propensity score analyses. Study size Figure 1 Figure 1 clearly presents all people who were excluded at each stage and the remaining study sample size. Quantitative variables The sub-sections titled “analytic sample and variable selection” and “statistical analysis” The authors describe how the continuous variables were derived for the outcome variable, and further, how the resulting outcome variable was dichotomized. Statistical methods Throughout the sub-section titled “statistical analysis” The authors provide adequate information about descriptive, inferential, missing data and sensitivity analyses, including the statistical software and packages. The level of information provided ensures the reproducibility of the results if needed. The authors also include citations for relevant methods or analyses. 3.2.2 Example 2 This example is taken from Nethery et al. (2019), which was based on the CCHS data. You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 2: A study about the household income and contraceptive methods (Nethery et al. 2019) Elements Location in the methods section Comments Study design The sub-section titled “data source, design and study population” The authors state that this was a cross-sectional study. Setting The sub-section titled “data source, design and study population” The data source for the study, CCHS, is described including the target population, location, timeframe, response rates and sampling design. Participants The sub-section titled “analytic sample” The authors describe how the analytic dataset was drawn from the CCHS data including the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As in the first example, the authors include a flowchart as Figure 1 to illustrate who were included/excluded at each stage, resulting in the analytic sample. Variables The sub-sections titled “outcome variables” and “exposure variable” The definitions of outcome and exposure variables are stated clearly. The authors provide additional details on the outcome variables, including some potential sources of bias, which enhances the readers ability to interpret the findings. The authors also explain how the exposure variable was dichotomized. Data sources/measurement The sub-sections titled “outcome variables” and “exposure variable” The authors outline specific questions from the CCHS (data source) that were used to derive the outcome and exposure variables. Bias The sub-sections titled “statistical analysis” and “sensitivity analysis” The authors describe some of the methods that were used to mitigate potential confounding (e.g. use of survey weights, multiple imputation, sensitivity analyses). The authors also provide the explanation behind the selection of confounders, providing background references. Study size Figure 1 As in the first example, Figure 1 presents all people who were excluded at each stage and the remaining analytic sample size. Quantitative variables N/A The key outcome and explanatory variables in this study were binary. In the “statistical analysis” sub-section, it is mentioned that the “age” variable is included as a confounder, and it isn’t clear whether this was a continuous or a categorical variable. However, this is neither key outcome nor explanatory variable, so the level of detail is perhaps not required. Statistical methods The sub-sections titled “statistical analysis” and “sensitivity analysis” The authors provide details on the descriptive, inferential, missing data and sensitivity analyses, including the statistical software and packages. Other The sub-section titled “ethics approval” The ethics approval for the use of data source is stated briefly. 3.3 Significance of the methods section in population and public health research paper In population and public health, the methods section of the research paper should enable readers to assess the internal and external validity of the study. It should provide all the necessary information to understand in which ways the authors have made efforts to try to address their research question as accurately as possible. As Rothman et al. describes, generally the goal of epidemiologic research is to “obtain a valid and precise estimate of the frequency of a disease or of the effect of an exposure on the occurrence of a disease in the source population of the study” (Rothman 2008, 128–47). In addition, as the introduction section would have described the importance of the research question in relation to the population and public health, researchers often aim to generalize the study findings to the relevant population groups. By providing clear and adequate information about the target population and how the study sample was selected from the source population, the methods section allows the readers to assess the generalizability of the study findings. As such, a well-written methods section in a research paper in population and public health should contain necessary information about the analytical steps undertaken in the study, and sufficient description of the study design and target population to enable readers to understand what some of the potential sources of bias in the study are, and what measures were taken to minimize the bias. This allows the readers to interpret the internal and external validity of the study. A well-written methods section provides credibility and validity of the results and conclusions of the study. After reading the methods section, the readers should have an understanding of the dataset which is under consideration in the study, who the target population was, how the data was collected, and how the analytic data was created (who are included and excluded). Based on the analytic steps described in the methods section, the readers should also be able to understand how the results and conclusions in the next sections of the paper derive from the statistical analyses. Finally, the readers should be able to replicate the study if needed and reproduce the results if they had access to the data source. 3.4 Common pitfalls Common pitfalls in the methods section can largely arise from not reviewing the key elements of the methods section carefully and missing some of the elements in consequence. Missing crucial elements providing information on the potential sources of selection or information bias can result in losing the reviewers’ and editors’ confidence in the validity and credibility of the study findings. Another common problem is not providing any explanations regarding the variable selection (i.e. how the covariates were included or not included in the model). Be mindful about plagiarism and self-plagiarism, especially if you are using the same data source or similar methods from previously published work. 3.5 Tips As in the introduction section, excessive and unnecessary details are discouraged. Unless the focus of your paper is the methodological approach, only discuss enough details to enable reproducibility and to highlight the elements that are relevant for the interpretation of the results. We talked about presenting the research as a “story,” any detail that are unnecessary or redundant to understanding this story should be avoided. The methods section should also include a statement on the ethical approval or any other ethical considerations. It’s often a good idea to include a citation for the statistical test or method, if this is relatively unknown to the readers. This can also increase the credibility of the methods presented. Some journals focused on patient-oriented research encourage researchers to include any processes or efforts that were made to include patients or the community members during research. If patients or community members were involved in the study at any step, it can be a good idea to describe what their involvement was. References "],["tables-and-figures.html", "Chapter 4 Tables and Figures 4.1 Designing a table 4.2 Designing a figure 4.3 Tables and figures in population and public health research papers 4.4 Common pitfalls 4.5 Tips", " Chapter 4 Tables and Figures So far, we have looked at the components of the introduction and the methods sections of a scientific research paper. Before looking at all the components of the results section, we will discuss the most crucial elements of the results section, and perhaps of the entire research paper, the tables and figures. Tables and figures are an integral part of a scientific article as they give an overview of the results obtained from the analyses. For many readers, reviewers and editors, these are the first elements they will look at when reading a paper. Therefore, well designed tables and figures are an effective tool to convey findings and can make a great impression on the readers even before they dive into the paper. It is widely known that tables and figures are an efficient way to present the key study findings (Kotz and Cals 2013c). Kotz and Cals (Kotz and Cals 2013c) suggest planning on which findings to portray in the tables and figures early in the writing process. Once this is determined, the most important aspect when designing the tables and figures is that they should be ‘standalone,’ or self-explanatory. The readers should gain a complete understanding of the message you are trying to convey just by looking at the table or the figure. To help with this, there are a few recommended guidelines for designing tables and figures. Below we discuss the components that can optimize the tables and figures in a scientific research article in the field of population and public health. 4.1 Designing a table As discussed, tables in a scientific paper should be concise, but standalone. Tables must be accompanied with an informative title, descriptive column headers and descriptive row labels. A footnote should also be included that explains any abbreviations used and the analyses that were applied to produce the results in the table. Titles: titles should be self-contained and informative. According to the American Journal of Epidemiology, titles should include details on the location of the study, the time period over which the study was conducted and the study population (AJE Editorial Office 2021). Even if including these details lengthens the title, it is important to include all the necessary information so that readers don’t have to go back to the manuscript to find the information they need to understand the table. Column headers: column headers should be succinct but descriptive as these introduce the table to the readers, along with the title. Row labels: when variables have multiple categories consider using a hierarchical representation (i.e., via indenting) and specify which category was used as the reference. Footnote: footnotes should include the definitions of the abbreviations and details on the statistical tests and analyses used. Furthermore, rather than duplicating information in the main text, the tables should be used to complement it, and vice versa. You should try to organize the tables in a way that ensures the reader can easily and quickly digest and comprehend the information within. Some formatting tips include: Designing the table layout with three horizontal lines in total: a line at the top of the table, a line below the column headers and a line at the bottom of the table. If the table is particularly large, shading can be used to demarcate the rows. Drawing horizontal and vertical lines inside the table is highly discouraged. The number of columns should be kept to a minimum. For example, instead of having a column for the p-values, you should consider using significance codes to indicate the level of statistical significance. For example, different numbers of asterisks can be used (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001) (Kotz and Cals 2013c). Whether the p-values are one-sided or two-sided should be specified. Some journals suggest only reporting two-sided p-values unless a one-sided test is required by the study design. As for decimal places for the p-values, the NEJM recommends reporting p-values larger than 0.01 with two decimal places, those between 0.01 and 0.001 with three decimal places, and those smaller than 0.001 as P&lt;0.001 (NEJM Editorial Board 2021). When reporting p-values or confidence intervals, the statistical test used to obtain the values needs to be described. For decimal points, do not report numbers with too many decimal places. The units of measurement for the study variables should be reported. For example, age in years or increments of 10 years, BMI in kg/m2, physical activity (min/day), etc. When displaying data in a table, do not include too many significant figures. Do not over-stylize the data using the bold, italic, and underline options (Franzblau and Chung 2012). 4.2 Designing a figure A figure can be useful when you have a lot of data that you’d like to describe or when you’d like to convey a key message. Deciding between a table or a figure depends on what kind of information you’re looking to present. If your data is representing a trend, pattern or association (in particular, if there is a non-linear trend), a figure may be able to convey the information more efficiently than a table. However, if it is important to present the exact numbers for the results, consider using a table rather than a figure. Similar to the tables, figures must be accompanied with a detailed title, descriptive labels for the y- and x-axes, a legend explaining any symbols, colours and line types, and a footnote. Generally, the title for a figure generally is placed under the image, and the footnote is placed under the title. Keep in mind the main message you are aiming to convey with the figure. It can take some time to design a figure that meets your needs. Some general guidelines include: Some journals may charge additional fees to print coloured figures. Therefore, it will be likely be less costly to design the initial figure in black and white. If you decide to make figures with colours, you should consider colour combinations and palettes that are accessible or colour-blind friendly. For example, the R ‘ggplot2’ package offers some colour-blind friendly palettes (Chang 2018). You can access the chapter here. Avoid using unnecessary grid lines inside the graph or plot, except for a reference line when necessary (e.g., a line indicating a Hazard Ratio (HR) or Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.0 in a forest plot). When placing graphs and plots side-by-side, be mindful of the scale of the graphs to avoid misleading the readers. It’s always a good idea to use the same scale across the graphs and figures. Avoid complicated, confusing figures such as 3-dimensional graphs (Franzblau and Chung 2012). 4.3 Tables and figures in population and public health research papers In research articles in epidemiology or in population and public health, generally, table 1 presents the sociodemographic and/or clinical characteristics of the study population stratified by the levels of the explanatory variable. For research papers based on a large survey datasets, table 1 includes descriptive statistics such as counts (number of people in the study sample in each category), proportions (accounting for the survey design), as well as means and standard deviations (also accounting for the survey design). Table 1 allows readers to compare the variables of interest across the levels of the explanatory/exposure variable of interest and may help them to gain an understanding of the research question. Sometimes, the authors test for differences and include a column for the p-values to indicate whether the variables presented are distributed differentially across the levels of the exposure. Table 2 usually presents the results of the primary inferential analysis assessing the research question, i.e., the association between the main explanatory and outcome variables under investigation. If there are multiple models used or additional outcomes considered, multiple columns can be included in this table. The footnote for the table usually includes information on the analytical model, the variable selection approach and the relevant tests of significance. This table generally reports the effect of the exposure or the specific level of the explanatory variable on the outcome after adjustment for potential confounders. Additional tables can be included that present the results of the effect modification analyses or any other sensitivity analyses that provide additional clarity to the study. Figure 1 is most often a flowchart showing how the authors obtained the final study sample after going through the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria should be detailed and the exact number of people excluded at each step should be provided. Other figures in epidemiological studies or studies in population and public health can include: directed acyclic graphs, survival curves, forest plots, histograms, boxplots and maps. Figures and tables are useful tools for highlighting the important findings of the study. Designing great tables and figures during the manuscript preparation phase can also be helpful for other knowledge translation activities For example, when making conference posters or oral presentations. Finally, there should be coherence between the text in the manuscript and the tables and figures. That is, the tables and figures should have a meaningful connection to the text in the results section and the story you are trying to tell in your manuscript. 4.4 Common pitfalls Having too many tables and figures: Many journals usually restrict the number of tables and figures that can be includes in the main article. Having too many figures and tables can be distracting. In addition, each table or figure needs to be explained in the text of the manuscript. Even when you have opted to include some tables and figures in the supplementary materials, they need to be explained in the main text. As for the other sections, you need to find a balance between too much and too little information. Avoid duplication. Sometimes the authors present the same data in a table and a figure. Tables and figures should be supplementary to each other and the text in the article to emphasize the key findings and convey a continuous story. 4.5 Tips When describing concepts in your article, be consistent in your use of keywords throughout the text, tables and figures in the article. This is particularly important if there are many terms used in the literature to describe a concept. All tables and figures must be referenced in the text and should follow a chronological order. There shouldn’t be a table or a figure that is not cited in the text. Sometimes, you may have too much information in the manuscript which causes it to exceed the word limit. This information may be essential for the manuscript. In some instances, you may be able to create a table to describe some of the details in the methods rather than having to describe them all in the manuscript. In addition, some tables can include both the text descriptions and the results. If you have a target journal in mind, review the journal instructions. Formatting requirements figures and tables may differ by journal.

It should provide a clear and concise summary of the findings from the research study. The authors should report the findings that were estimated using the approaches presented in the methods section, in the same order as in the methods section and the writing should be free from interpretations. It may appear that the results is the simplest section to write. However, authors must carefully prepare this section to maintain the readers’ attention and interest, and to facilitate understanding of the study. Although the results section generally only contains the quantitative information (except for qualitative and mixed-methods studies), it should still be easy to follow and understand. Presenting the findings in the results section in the same sequence as the procedures were presented in the methods section can improve the flow of the paper. In general, the results section has the following order: (i) the study sample or population characteristics, (ii) findings from the primary analysis, (iii) findings from the secondary analyses, and (iv) any additional findings that may be important to the understanding of the readers. Below are the key characteristics and typical organization of a results section in a scientific paper based on an observational study in population and public health, along with some common pitfalls and tips. 5.1 Key characteristics and organization of a results section Study sample characteristics and descriptive statistics Generally, the characteristics of the study sample are described first in the results section. This can be accompanied by a flowchart detailing the inclusion and exclusion criteria that were applied to generate the final analytic sample. Rather than being overly detailed, the sample characteristics should be summarized using key information. A table containing more detailed information can be referenced to ensure the results are concise. The results section can also include the descriptive statistics for the outcome and explanatory variable, including the prevalence of a categorical outcome and/or exposure, the incidence rates of a categorical outcome in prospective studies and, the mean and standard deviation of a continuous outcome and/or exposure. Typically, descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Findings of the primary analysis The findings of the main research question, based on the primary analysis, are presented in this section. Estimates from the crude/unadjusted and the adjusted models evaluating the relationship between the exposure and outcome can be reported. Authors should note whether the relationship changed or remained the same following adjustment. Generally, the findings from the adjusted model for the main relationship under investigation are presented in table 2. When reporting the estimates in table 2, use caution not to introduce the table 2 fallacy (Westreich and Greenland 2013). Findings from the secondary analyses If interaction, effect modification or sub-group analyses were performed, the findings from these analyses should be presented in relation to the primary research question. No new interaction should be added without providing proper justification in the earlier sections. The relationships between the confounders and the outcome can also be described (but, not interpreted), in order to help readers understand the relationship under investigation. Any additional findings to highlight Additional findings from sensitivity analyses or other interesting findings can also be highlighted. The results section should describe the study findings without being unduly pedantic or repetitive. Authors are discouraged to detail every analysis details when presenting the corresponding results and to describe redundant findings. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the results section should describe all the tables and figures included in the article. However, it is unnecessary to describe them in great detail. As the tables and figures are used to portray a large amount of data in an efficient manner, the text in the results section should summarize the key findings that are important to convey to the readers. These can include trends or patterns present in the data, group comparisons, or key estimates. Although, ideally, the results section presents the study findings in a clear and objective manner, it should also be presented as a ‘story.’ That is, the information should have a logical flow. Some authors may opt to write the results section before writing the other sections. Regardless of the order in which you write your scientific article, you should always keep in mind the ‘whole story’ of your study and what it is you are trying to convey in your paper. Based on the research question that you posed in the introduction section and the statistical procedures you explained in the methods section, the results section provides readers with the findings from your study. You’ll have the opportunity to provide explanations for these results in the discussion section. Whichever section you choose to write first, they should all work together to tell the research ‘story.’ 5.2 Common pitfalls The most common pitfall is including components of the methods and discussion sections in the results section. There should be a distinct separation between the methods, results and discussion sections. This separation has been encouraged as readers may be interested in different sections; some may be more interested in the methods because they wish to replicate them, some may be only interested in reading the results to include them in a meta-analysis, and some may skim through the results as they are more concerned with the interpretation in the discussion section (Heard 2016, 99–119). Having a clear separation of the sections can help the readers quickly find the elements they are most interested in. Not reporting clearly which findings are from the primary or secondary or sensitivity analyses can be confusing to the reader. Focusing too heavily on the crude or unadjusted analysis should be avoided, as most unadjusted estimates from observational studies are likely confounded. Perhaps most importantly, it is crucial to report the findings objectively, without trying to influence the readers. For example, it is misleading to write an effect size was “marginally significant” when it was not statistically significant at a 5% significance level. In addition, Kotz and Cals argue that only presenting p-values can be misleading. They encourage the inclusion of 95% confidence intervals as they provide additional information such as the direction of the effect size, the size of the effect estimate and the degree of precision (Kotz and Cals 2013b). 5.3 Tips The results are generally presented in the past tense. However, when referencing a table or a figure, they may be described in the present tense. Avoid reporting redundant numbers, as this can make the paragraphs dense. For example, if you are reporting the 95 confidence intervals of your estimates, it may not be necessary to report the p-values. Only present the results and data that is necessary for readers to understand why the conclusion you are drawing about the research question is justified. As with all the other sections, excess information can be distracting from the central point of your article. The results section should be absent of any interpretation of the findings or data. You will have an opportunity to interpret the results in the discussion section. Having sub-section headings can improve the readability and flow of the results section. Always be consistent in the way you report the study findings, including the order of presentation (e.g., the exposed group followed by the control group), the number of decimals, the terms used and the units of measurement. In addition, it is encouraged to include the absolute numbers when presenting relative measures (e.g., if reporting proportions, provide the counts in parentheses).

In comparison to the other sections, the discussion section allows the authors the most freedom in writing and structuring the text, making it both liberating and challenging to write. The objective of a discussion section is to answer the research questions that were raised in the introduction by interpreting the findings presented in the previous results section. Further, the discussion section gives the authors the opportunity to explain the study findings and their implications to a broader audience. The introduction and the discussion sections are intrinsically connected; the questions posed in the introduction are addressed in the discussion, and the key problems that are discussed in detail in the discussion were introduced earlier in the introduction. In the introduction section, the author starts with broad background information on the topic and gradually narrow down to present the specific research question(s) and the reasons supporting the need to conduct the study. The discussion section is where the author gets to address all the components touched upon in the introduction, turn the data presented in the results section into “knowledge” and provide a compelling argument on how the findings of the study contribute to existing knowledge, and why it was worthwhile to do the study. 6.1 Components of a discussion section Keeping the connection between the introduction and the discussion section in mind, the discussion section follows an inversed funnel shape that gradually broadens, as opposed to the narrowing funnel shape that describes the components of the introduction section (Chapter 1). The discussion starts narrow, with responses to the specific research questions, and gradually broadens as the study findings are compared to previous studies and placed in the wider context of the topic. The strengths and limitations of the study are then discussed, and future directions are provided. Below, we discuss the components of the discussion section in detail. Summary of the main findings The summary of the main findings provides answers to the specific research question that was posed in the introduction section. If there were many research questions or if the question was very complex, the author can briefly remind the readers what the research question was at a high level. The key findings for the main research question should be interpreted first, followed by findings from any secondary analyses. The authors should explicitly and concisely state the verdict on the research question when summarizing the main findings, as this is the key information that readers are looking for. Overreaching conclusions or overgeneralizations of the study findings should be avoided. The results should be interpreted based solely on the people who were included in the study sample. Though, it is reasonable for authors to make speculations based on the results, they should refrain from misrepresenting speculation as inference (Heard 2016, 120–25). Contextualizing the study findings within the existing literature In the introduction section, the objective of presenting the background knowledge was to introduce the readers to the topic and to set the tone for the rest of the manuscript. In the discussion section, the results of the study are interpreted. Therefore, in this section, the author can expand on the high-level information introduced in the beginning of the manuscript and contextualize the findings of the study within the literature. The study findings are compared to previous studies to contextualize them in the existing literature. By comparing the study findings to similar previous studies, the author can determine whether their study findings agreed with or were contradictory to previous studies. If the findings of the study were similar, the author should explain why their new study was needed, and how it contributes to the literature. If the findings were conflicting, the author can explore the reasons for this discrepancy. While relating the study findings to other studies and placing the current study in the literature are important components of a discussion section, it’s main focus should be on how the analysis and findings of this study adds to the existing body of evidence. Clinical or public health relevance of the study findings The target audience of a scientific article in population and public health research may include clinicians, other researchers, patient communities and members of the general public with an interest in the specific health topic. It is critical to stress the relevance of the study findings to the target audience. The author should keep the specific target audience in mind when explaining why the study findings are significant. For example, if the study’s goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug in treating a particular condition, the author may emphasize how the findings are important for patients, and how they may affect clinical decisions for healthcare providers. Strengths and limitations In this sub-section, the author explains the study’s specific strengths and limitations. This is a particularly challenging and important section to compose as reviewers and readers will scrutinize it closely. The strengths and limitations that are unique to the study should be discussed. For example, authors should address how the study has done something new, how it adds to current knowledge, or how it supplements, reinforces, or contradicts previous research. Similarly, rather than discussing limitations that are generic or applicable to most studies, the limitations that are specific to the current study should be highlighted. Limitations can be related to the data, design or the methods used in the study. Unmeasured confounding specific to the study, untestable assumptions related to the study, and lost-to-follow-up or missing data are all examples of limitations. In addition, it is crucial to describe not only the limitations, but also the measures taken to mitigate them. It is critical to clearly state the limitations of the study. But, the discussion section is also where the author can defend their work and demonstrate to readers and reviewers what steps were taken to mitigate the limitations and to strengthen the robustness of the findings. It can be good practice to approach the strengths and limitations section as if it was a critical appraisal or a peer-review. Authors can ask themselves: what kinds of issues might the reviewers raise about the study? What are the potential biases? The author can anticipate these questions in advance and prepare the responses accordingly. For example, when discussing potential sources of bias or imprecision, the author can discuss the direction and magnitude of the bias or imprecision, as well as how this may affect the study findings, and what efforts were made to minimize the bias. When discussing the strengths and limitations, the author can elucidate on the robustness and the generalizability of the study findings, as well as the reproducibility of the study. Future directions and implications Depending on the focus of the paper, the discussion section should describe some of the potential study implications for clinical practice and/or research. Cals and Kotz also suggest that simply stating “further research is needed” is insufficient (Cals and Kotz 2013b). Based on the study findings, what are the next steps for the research in this area? The author should make recommendations for future research, based on the remaining unanswered questions or unavailable variables, measures or outcomes in the data. The description of future directions should be short and specific. It may be a good idea to conclude the paper with an overall ‘big-picture’ of the study; what is the take-home message now that you’ve presented the ‘story’ of your study to the readers? The summary of the study implications should be clear and concise, written in a such way that general readers can easily grasp the key message of the study. 6.2 Additional tips The purpose of the discussion section is: to provide readers with a summary of the main findings and, based on these, the answers to the central research questions posed in the introduction section, to contextualize the study findings by comparing them to previous work, and to analyze the study’s specific strengths and limitations. Through this process, the author expands on the findings of the study in order to provide the most persuasive interpretations and find the broadest significance, as well as describe the study implications and offer future directions in the specific research area. The following are some additional do’s and dont’s for a discussion section. Table 1: Do’s and Dont’s of writing a discussion section Do’s Dont’s It is okay to make speculations based on the research findings, however, make sure that you present these as speculations and not as causal inferences. Also, be clear about the study limitations Do not present in detail all of the possible sensitivity analyses or all of the sensitivity analyses that you conducted. Only discuss those that contribute to the robustness of your interpretation of the study findings Discuss if there was anything surprising about the findings or if the results went against the initial hypothesis Do not omit any potential alternative explanations of the findings of your study. In the discussion section, reviewers will mainly be focused on whether the interpretations and conclusions drawn were supported by the evidence presented, and whether there were any alternative explanations that may be plausible Present the key limitations of the study and how they may have impacted the results Do not restate the findings too repetitively. The paper should end with a clear summarizing statement of the manuscript’s storyline. Provide the answer to the research questions at the beginning of the discussion section. Ensure that your answer is in line with the research question presented in the introduction section. Do not interpret the absence of statistical significance as the absence of association. The findings should not be interpreted solely based on the p-values of the statistical tests (Lederer et al. 2019) Learn to criticize your own work and acknowledge the limitations transparently. But, also use the discussion section as an opportunity to defend your work and to talk about the steps that were taken to mitigate limitations References "],["title-and-abstract.html", "Chapter 7 Title and Abstract 7.1 Components of an abstract 7.2 Characteristics of a good abstract 7.3 Tips for writing an abstract 7.4 Title of a scientific article", " Chapter 7 Title and Abstract A well composed title and abstract are critical to a good scientific article because they are the two components that most people will read first. During the submission process to journals, the abstract is the first part of the manuscript that editors will read to decide whether to send the manuscript for review. Once the article is published, the abstract is the first part most readers will read, and sometimes, the only part of the article that the readers are able to consume. The abstract is also an important indication of the quality of the research. For example, most scientific conferences will base their selection of presentations solely on the abstract. Therefore, a well-written title and abstract are essential for the publication of a scientific article as well as for conference submissions. They are also crucial for conveying a clear, informative story to the readers who may only get to read the title and the abstract. In this chapter, we discuss characteristics of a good abstract and title as well as some tips and examples. 7.1 Components of an abstract As the abstract gives editors, reviewers and readers the first impression of the study, it is critical that it contains all the necessary information, including the study aims, main findings and interpretations. Generally, abstracts need to be short, between 200 to 300 words, and are structured in subsections. The headings of the subsections depend on the journal or the conference, but the essential components tend to be consistent. Below we present four subsections that are often used to compose a structured abstract: background, methods, results and discussion. Background – “What is known in the literature, why is the current study needed?” The background should contain a very brief summary of the corresponding background section of the manuscript, laying out what is the “key” evidence in the literature known to date and what is the gap in the knowledge that justifies the present study. This subsection should clearly identify the rationale for conducting the study. Following the rationale, the study aim or the main research question must be clarified. Methods – “What did you do?” The abstract should describe what methods were used to answer the scientific question or to accomplish the study aim. This section should have a brief explanation of the data source used in the study, the study time frame and the statistical methods used to conduct the primary analysis. Results – “What did you find?” In the abstract, key findings from the primary analysis should be presented. The analytic sample or the study population should be clearly described, as well as the effect size estimates such as the odds ratios, hazard ratios and the 95% confidence intervals. Reporting 95% confidence intervals rather than p-values can inform the readers about the strength, direction and variability of the estimates. Discussion – “What do the results mean? And so what?” The main findings should be interpreted clearly and accurately. It is crucial to interpret the results carefully as to not mislead the readers. The discussion section also needs to convey what the key implications of the findings are. These may be implications for future research and for the general understanding of the topic under investigation. It is also a good idea to discuss the main limitations of the study. Particularly for observational studies, it is important to be transparent about any major limitations that might limit the internal validity and generalizability of the study. 7.2 Characteristics of a good abstract A well-structured abstract, even without the subsections, should describe the research questions, aims and methods; be critical of the key findings and major limitations; and be insightful, discussing the key contribution to the literature and implications of the study. The title and abstract of the study are the components that are indexed in the literature databases and are openly accessible to all readers, even when the study is published in a subscription-based journal. Therefore, some readers may only be able to access the abstract, which is why it’s crucial for the abstract to be standalone. It should summarize all the important aspects of the study, and just by reading the abstract, the readers should be able to gain an understanding of what was done, how it was done and what was found. As abstracts are required to be short and succinct, it should avoid having too many technical details or nuanced discussion. Writing a good abstract involves highlighting the study aim and gap in the literature, and describing how the study tried to address the gap or to contribute to current knowledge. Finally, by reading the abstract, it should be clear to readers what the key take home message is. 7.3 Tips for writing an abstract Write the paper first; then, re-read the paper and think about the purpose of the study, and the implications of the main finding. Keep in mind what the key messages you want to convey to readers are. It may help to write down the keywords or key messages in a list before starting to write the abstract. Take time to write, revise and re-write the abstract. The abstract is important; journal editors, conference abstract reviewers and other researchers will judge the quality of the research based on the abstract. A well-written abstract can leave a good impression. The abstract should be written in an active voice; many journals support the use of active voice over the use of passive voice (with the exception of the methods section). Most concepts and results are conveyed more succinctly and clearly when written in an active voice (Nature Portfolio 2021; The BMJ 2021). When using subsections, each section should have two to three sentences. Additionally, the language should be simple and free of jargon/terms that are too discipline-specific. Abstract should be free of any citations or references, and the use of abbreviations should be minimal. The use of Greek letters or special characters should be avoided, as it might cause formatting issues in some indexing databases. While re-reading the abstract, note if all the sections flow coherently. Do the reported results match the research question? Are the implications specific to the results presented? With the limited word count allocated to the abstract, it is likely that there will be no space to discuss the results of the sensitivity analyses. If space permits, it is acceptable to simply report that the sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the main findings, without necessarily presenting all the results. The EQUATOR Network provides guidelines for reporting observational studies in a conference abstract (STROBE Group 2021). Some of the key elements of the guidelines include: Title should include the study’s design, such as cohort study, case-control or cross-sectional study. In the abstract, study design and specific objectives should be clarified. The methods section should include the study setting, the timeframe, and describe the study participants, including the eligibility criteria and the statistical methods. The results section should include the number of participants included in the analytic sample, the main results, including the estimates of associations, and the measures of variability and uncertainty. The conclusions section should include the general interpretation of the study results. 7.4 Title of a scientific article Even before the abstract, the title is the first thing readers look at, hence it is a very important element of a scientific article. Though the title shouldn’t be “click-bait,” it should still pique the interest of the readers. Moreover, it should be brief and straightforward while still conveying the central story of the paper or the main research question. The title should be coherent and consistent with the abstract, but not completely copy the main text. As the title is indexed in the databases, it should contain all the important keywords to facilitate the literature search. In population and public health research, we propose three types of titles: descriptive titles, informative/assertive titles, and inquisitive titles. Descriptive titles are used most often, and usually describe the main topic or association that is under investigation. The informative or “assertive sentence” titles (Heard 2016, 79–83) are not always preferred by all readers since they may be perceived as being too conclusive without supporting arguments or explanations, but they are catchy and summarize the key message of the study. Finally, inquisitive titles actually present the main scientific question that is addressed in the research paper. Table 1 presents some examples in the literature of different types of titles in epidemiology and health sciences research. Table 1: Titles of scientific articles in epidemiology, population and public health research Study of mirtazapine for agitated behaviours in dementia (SYMBAD): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial This is an example of a descriptive title which presents the name of the trial presented, SYMBAD, and also describes the design of the study, which was a randomised controlled trial. Obesity management as a primary treatment goal for type 2 diabetes: time to reframe the conversation This is another example of a descriptive title. We can assume that the keywords of this study are “obesity management” and “treatment for type 2 diabetes.” The latter part of the title “time to reframe…” also suggests that the study might be presenting a novel aspect to existing clinical guidelines for treatment of diabetes. Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care: cluster randomised controlled trial This is also a descriptive title; in this title the authors present the main association under investigation (“effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein” on “hip fractures and falls”), and the population group of interest (older adults in residential care), as well as the study design (cluster randomised controlled trial). Sustained virological response from interferon-based hepatitis C regimens is associated with reduced risk of extrahepatic manifestations This is an example of an assertive sentence title; the title indicates the main finding of the study, which was that the sustained virological response from a treatment was associated with reduced risk of extrahepatic manifestations. Convenience and comfort: reasons reported for using drugs alone among clients of harm reduction sites in British Columbia, Canada This is an example of an informative title which gives the readers the answer to their main research question “what were the reasons for using drugs alone?” as “Convenience and comfort” among the study population of interest (clients using harm reduction sites in British Columbia, Canada). Are perceived barriers to accessing health care associated with inadequate antenatal care visits among women of reproductive age in Rwanda? This is an example of an inquisitive title, which in itself is the main research question that the paper is trying to answer. Are US adults with low-exposure to methylmercury at increased risk for depression? A study based on 2011–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) This is another inquisitive title, which also indicates the data source for the study (2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys). “I want to get better, but…”: identifying the perceptions and experiences of people who inject drugs with respect to evolving hepatitis C virus treatments This is an example of a qualitative study in population and public health research, which uses a part of a quote from an interview with a study participant to present the central aim of the study, which was to identify the perception and experiences of people who inject drugs, with respect to evolving hepatitis C treatments References "],["authorship.html", "Chapter 8 Authorship", " Chapter 8 Authorship "],["peer-review.html", "Chapter 9 Peer-review", " Chapter 9 Peer-review "],["responding-to-reviewer-comments.html", "Chapter 10 Responding to reviewer comments", " Chapter 10 Responding to reviewer comments "],["collaborative-tools.html", "Chapter 11 Collaborative Tools 11.1 Rmarkdown 11.2 GitHub", " Chapter 11 Collaborative Tools 11.1 Rmarkdown 11.2 GitHub "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
