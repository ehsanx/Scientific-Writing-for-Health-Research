One of the components of this course has a focus on scientific communication. Specifically, communicating with the scientific community about an epidemiological study that has been designed to answer a particular health research question and appropriately interpreting the study results. Students write a research article suitable for submission to an academic peer-reviewed health journal for publication. However, a general challenge of teaching scientific communication is that most of the associated teaching materials and references are either overly general (not discipline-specific, do not take into account applications to healthcare), or not openly accessible (expensive textbooks). Also, SPPH students have varying academic backgrounds, and many are not familiar with new scientific writing collaboration tools that are helpful for managing collaborative projects and can aid in conducting reproducible research. This OER project will allow us to make the course content open to other UBC health researchers who struggle with scientific writing and introduce them to tools that will help them manage collaborative group research projects. The project aims to create and share openly accessible high-quality OER content through a step-by-step educational guide on how to write scientific articles for peer-reviewed journals, with a specific focus on communicating with the health research community. Specific topics include: Scientific writing basics, components of a good research question Writing the ‘Introduction’ section, identifying a gap in the literature Writing the ‘Methods’ section, describing the data sources/collection, study design, and statistical analysis Presenting tables and figures, and writing the ‘Results’ section Writing the ‘Discussion’ section, interpreting results, stating the implications, strengths and limitations of the study, and future research Introducing tools for managing collaborative scientific writing projects and reproducible research (e.g., RMarkdown, GitHub). Project Goals Background: The principal applicant is teaching a UBC course (SPPH 504-007). In this course, one of the components is the communication of scientific research findings through scientific writing. The specific goals are stated below. Goals: The goals of the project are to (1) create and update course content and materials as open educational resources (OERs), and (2) openly share a step-by-step guide (i.e., written OER content, primarily text) on how to write scientific articles for peer-reviewed journals (in the “IMRaD” format; structured in the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). (3) Introduce some cutting-edge tools helpful for managing collaborative scientific writing projects and conducting reproducible research (e.g., RMarkdown, GitHub). Implication: One obvious implication is increased accessibility to students. Currently, the course SPPH 504-007 is restricted to SPPH Ph.D. students. If this rapid grant project is successful, this content will be openly accessible and will potentially help health researchers across campus interested in publishing manuscripts on their health data research. Examples of people who will directly benefit from this open access project include: SPPH master’s students (e.g., MSc, MPH, MHA, who cannot currently register for this course), researchers from all the Departments in the UBC Faculty of Medicine, and any other Departments with researchers that conduct healthcare and biomedical data analysis and research. Format: Content will primarily be text, that will be placed on an openly accessible GitHub page. Where necessary, tables, pictures and multi-media will be included. Short videos will be embedded to summarize important sections of the content. Version history Initial outlines were created for SPPH 504-007 during 2018-2021. In 2021, though OER Fund Rapid Innovation Grant and WorkLearn program, a GRA was hired to convert the outlines to drafts, that were revised and updated by other contributors. Feel free to reach out for any comments, corrections, suggestions.

The introduction section sets the stage for the entire paper and introduces the topic of interest to the audience. This first section provides a broad context of the issue under investigation, summarizes what is known and unknown, and tries to convince the readers that this particular study will be a valuable addition to current knowledge. There are several guidelines suggesting how to best structure the introduction section for a research paper (Cals and Kotz 2013; Bahadoran et al. 2018; Heard 2016, 84–88). Typically, a well-written introduction section will contain broader background information on the topic, a summary of key existing knowledge relevant to the specific problem, the gap in the current knowledge (rationale), and the research question and/or the hypothesis. Though not essential, some authors may opt to briefly describe the study design and methods. 2.1 Funnel shape To better organize the main components of the introduction, it may be useful to build an outline or a skeleton of the section. One approach could be adopting a “funnel shape” or an inverted pyramid shape to organize the components. Based on the funnel shape, the introduction section has five key elements going from broad to narrow: big picture, what is known, what is unknown, research question and methods/design (see Figure 1). Figure 2.1: The typical funnel shape of an Introduction section. Big picture: the introduction starts with the big picture, represented by the broad opening of the funnel shape. The big picture introduces the general context of the research area and provides an overview of “why this topic or issue is important.” For a research paper in population and public health, it is a good idea to present the broader background information on the health-related topic. This may include the magnitude of the problem and/or the burden of disease (e.g., incidence, prevalence or cost). The big picture should provide the audience with an understanding of the study outcome or explanatory variable from a public health perspective. What is known: from the big picture, the author narrows down to a more specific research area under investigation. This part should outline the existing knowledge of the research area by providing a summary of the evidence, including the landmark and recent studies. This summary should cite the most current and comprehensive knowledge on the subject. Remember that the evidence cited should be directly relevant to your specific study and inform your research question. These summaries should focus on the particular exposure or disease of interest (e.g., intervention or outcome elements of the PICOT framework) (Thabane et al. 2009). What is unknown: as the funnel further narrows, this part should present a synthesis of the reasons why the issue is important (in the big picture), what is already known, and what is unknown, to convince the audience that there is a need to conduct your specific study. This part can include the gaps in current knowledge, any inconsistencies in the literature, gaps in the methodology or the need for different or better methodology. When describing what is unknown, the author should highlight the importance of conducting the present study and persuade the readers that this analysis was needed (rationale). Who would likely benefit from this study should also be highlighted. For example, if there is a previous study that answered the same research question, a clear and compelling argument on the need for the updated study should be included. Research question: following the identification of the gap in current knowledge, this part outlines the specific purpose of the study. It should include the study objective and/or hypothesis that will address the identified gap in current knowledge. Methods/design: as the last stage of the funnel, this part can briefly introduce the approach used to answer the research question. This can include the study design or methods, however, a brief summary is sufficient as the methodological approach will be described in depth in the methods section. 2.2 Examples 2.2.1 Example 1 The first example is taken from Nisingizwe et al. (2020). You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about the association between perceived barriers to health care access and inadequate antenatal care visits (Nisingizwe et al. 2020) Elements Location in the introduction section Comments Big picture 1st paragraph (“Maternal and neonatal mortality …”) Authors introduce the public health problem of interest, maternal and neonatal mortality, by presenting the magnitude of the problem and the burden of disease. This paragraph highlights the importance of the public health problem. What is known 2nd paragraph (“Timely and frequency of ANC …”) The authors describe the more specific research area: the relationship between receiving adequate antenatal care (ANC) and barriers to healthcare. 3rd paragraph (“However, the country’ maternal and neonatal death rates …”) The authors provide a summary of the existing knowledge relevant to the study that informs the research question. What is unknown 4th paragraph (“To date, there is a paucity …”) The authors present what is unknown: the relationship between perceived barriers to health care and inadequate ANC visits in Rwanda. In addition, they identify previous studies and the gaps in the current knowledge. The clear identification of a research gap supports the stated rationale for conducting this particular study. Research question 4th paragraph (“Therefore, this study aims …”) Following the identification of the gap in current knowledge, the authors present the specific purpose of the study. 5th paragraph (“We hypothesized that …”) The authors present the hypothesis for the research question. 5th paragraph (“This study will contribute to …”) the authors include a brief summary of the key study implications to convince the audience that this research paper will add value to the field of study. Methods/design The authors have not included a specific section summarizing the methodological approach used in the study to answer the research question. However, in the 4th paragraph, they indicated that the study will use a “country representative sample” from “2015 DHS data.” 2.2.2 Example 2 The second example is taken from Basham and Karim (2019). You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about prevalence of multimorbidity in northern vs. southern Canada (Basham and Karim 2019) Elements Location in the introduction section Comments Big picture 1st paragraph (“Multimorbidity is common among …”) The public health problem of interest, multimorbidity, is introduced along with the magnitude of the problem and the burden of disease. What is known and unknown 2nd paragraph (“Northern Canada, which …”) and 3rd paragraph (“The equivocacy of findings …”) The more specific research area, multimorbidity in Canadian provinces and territories, is contextualized. The authors provide a summary of relevant previous studies and highlight the gaps within these studies. The synthesis of the “big picture,” “what is known” and “what is unknown” elements supports the rationale for this particular study. Research question 3rd paragraph (“The primary aim of this study …”) Once the need for this particular study is identified, the authors present the specific research question and the hypothesis. Methods/design 3rd paragraph (“This study describes multimorbidity …”) The authors briefly mention the methodological approach used in the study. Through these 2 examples, we have looked at the key elements of an introduction section of a scientific article in population and public health research. The introduction section provides the general context of the topic (big picture), the narrower research area and what is known, the gap in the existing knowledge, the specific purpose of the study and a summary of the methods and design. 2.2.3 Importance of a ‘hook’ As the author and researcher, you have the knowledge of the “whole story” of your study from start to end. Hence, you can write the introduction strategically. The introduction section introduces the public health problem to the audience and tries to capture their interest to continue reading. In a newspaper or magazine article, the writer aims to grab the readers’ attention with a “hook” at the beginning. In a scientific article, although you don’t necessarily want to give out all the findings and study implications initially, you should utilize the introduction section to incite the readers’ and reviewers’ interest. By clearly outlining the key components, the introduction section should convince the audience that the population/public health issue under investigation is critical to address and that your particular study is novel and valuable. 2.3 Common pitfalls Common pitfalls in the introduction section include incomplete, inaccurate or outdated reviews of the literature on the topic. For example, including literature that is tangentially related or within the same field but not directly related to the problem, may result in an incomplete or confusing review of the background knowledge. Including inadequate, incomplete or outdated information may result in the rejection of the paper. Not adequately explaining the importance or the relevance of the current knowledge in relation to the study aims is another pitfall. This can lead to an introduction section that is less effective in communicating the relevancy and novelty of your study. 2.4 Tips Arguably, incorporating clear study aim(s) and rationales for the study objectives are the most important aspects of the introduction section. (i) Aims should be clearly articulated, and the design of the study should be planned accordingly. (ii) Take time to think about the justification of the current study. Provide only the key references that are needed to describe the background knowledge, as well as what is known and unknown about the topic of interest. Including an excessive amount of literature in the introduction can be distracting. Be mindful that you will have an opportunity to contextualize your research in the literature by comparing your findings with other studies in the Discussion section. The introduction should be focused on setting the tone for what is coming next. A lengthy introduction can also make the readers lose interest. A general suggestion is that the introduction section should be about 10-15% of the whole paper (Cals and Kotz 2013). If you already have a general idea of the journals that you would like to submit your article to, the introduction can be tailored to the audience of the target journal. For example, if you are interested in submitting to journals with a heavier focus on methodology or epidemiology, you may want to highlight the novelties in the design or methods. If you are interested in submitting to clinician-focused or subject-specific journals, you may emphasize the clinical or public health implications of the study.

The purpose of the methods section is to provide a comprehensive picture of the methodological approach of the study in a straightforward and transparent manner. Broadly, the methods section should allow the readers to understand the dataset under consideration and the analytical steps undertaken in the study, and give a sense of reproducibility of the study (Annesley 2010; Kotz and Cals 2013). 3.1 The “Bridge” Following the introduction section, the methods section connects the previously developed research question to the results section and equips the readers with all methodological details necessary to interpret the findings that will be presented in the next section. As such, the methods section is the “bridge” between the introduction and the results section. Typically, the main elements of a methods section are: study design and data collection; setting, analytic sample and variables; data and statistical analysis. Furthermore, breaking the methods section into sub-sections can be a helpful way to present the methodological approach in an organized fashion. The main elements of the methods section can be presented as sub-sections. Statement of study design and data collection: the study design (e.g. cohort study, cross-sectional study, etc) and other key elements of the study design should be mentioned early in the methods. The data source(s) and how data was collected should be detailed. Sampling strategy: for cross-sectional studies, it is recommended to describe the sampling design for the data source. Setting, analytic sample and variables: if relevant, the setting, locations and timeframe (e.g. recruitment, follow-up, data collection) can be described. For the analytic sample, how it was obtained from the target population should be clearly described, including inclusion and exclusion criteria. The key outcome and explanatory variables should be defined, including case definitions or algorithms. You can also present the details of methods of measurement or assessment if they are relevant, or if they are derived from other variables or measures. It is important to identify which covariates were included and why they were included or not included (variable selection). For the study population, if there are any differences between people who were included in the study population compared to those who were excluded from the source population, these differences should be described. Ethics approval: a statement about ethics approval from a research ethics board or other ethical considerations should be included. Data/statistical analysis: all statistical methods used for descriptive and inferential analyses should be described, including the methods used to control for confounding. If you have conducted sensitivity analyses, these should be described. The methods section should contain descriptions of statistical approach used for all findings presented in the results section. In general, the statistical program or software and the packages used are also stated in this section. When writing a scientific paper in epidemiology or in population and public health, the STROBE checklist (Von Elm et al. 2007) can be a helpful tool to ensure that you are reporting all necessary components in the methods section. Below we will have a look at two examples of papers presenting survey-based analysis with the STROBE checklist. 3.2 Examples 3.2.1 Example 1 This example is taken from Nikiforuk et al. (2021), which was based on the NHANES data. You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 1: A study about chronic hepatitis C infection and monocyte-to-platelet ratio (Nikiforuk et al. 2021) Elements Location in the methods section Comments Study design The sub-section titled “data, design and study population” The authors outline briefly this was a cross-sectional study. Setting The sub-section titled “data, design and study population” The data source for the study, NHANES, is described including the target population, location, timeframe and sampling design. Participants The second paragraph of the sub-section titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The authors describe how the analytic dataset was created from the data source. Exclusion criteria is also included. Figure 1 in the paper illustrates who were excluded at each stage and helps readers to understand potential sources of selection bias and how these might affect the generalizability. Variables The first and second paragraphs of the sub-section titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The exposure and outcome variables of interest are clearly defined, including the explanation of how the outcome variable “monocyte-to-platelet ratio” was derived from two variables, complete blood count measures of monocyte count and platelet count. The authors include an additional file for more detailed description. The authors also provide the justification of how covariates were identified, with a directed acyclic graph included as an additional file. Data sources/measurement The sub-sections titled “analytic sample and variable selection” The authors provide information on how the key variables were measured, and further provide a reference for additional information on the data source, NHANES. Bias Throughout the sub-section titled “statistical analysis” The authors described all methods applied to adjust for any potential confounding, such as in the sub-section “transformation of the monocyte-to-platelet ratio” and other methods including missing data and propensity score analyses. Study size Figure 1 Figure 1 clearly presents all people who were excluded at each stage and the remaining study sample size. Quantitative variables The sub-sections titled “analytic sample and variable selection” and “statistical analysis” The authors describe how the continuous variables were derived for the outcome variable, and further, how the resulting outcome variable was dichotomized. Statistical methods Throughout the sub-section titled “statistical analysis” The authors provide adequate information about descriptive, inferential, missing data and sensitivity analyses, including the statistical software and packages. The level of information provided ensures the reproducibility of the results if needed. The authors also include citations for relevant methods or analyses. 3.2.2 Example 2 This example is taken from Nethery et al. (2019), which was based on the CCHS data. You can download the open access PDF from here. Table 2: A study about the household income and contraceptive methods (Nethery et al. 2019) Elements Location in the methods section Comments Study design The sub-section titled “data source, design and study population” The authors state that this was a cross-sectional study. Setting The sub-section titled “data source, design and study population” The data source for the study, CCHS, is described including the target population, location, timeframe, response rates and sampling design. Participants The sub-section titled “analytic sample” The authors describe how the analytic dataset was drawn from the CCHS data including the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As in the first example, the authors include a flowchart as Figure 1 to illustrate who were included/excluded at each stage, resulting in the analytic sample. Variables The sub-sections titled “outcome variables” and “exposure variable” The definitions of outcome and exposure variables are stated clearly. The authors provide additional details on the outcome variables, including some potential sources of bias, which enhances the readers ability to interpret the findings. The authors also explain how the exposure variable was dichotomized. Data sources/measurement The sub-sections titled “outcome variables” and “exposure variable” The authors outline specific questions from the CCHS (data source) that were used to derive the outcome and exposure variables. Bias The sub-sections titled “statistical analysis” and “sensitivity analysis” The authors describe some of the methods that were used to mitigate potential confounding (e.g. use of survey weights, multiple imputation, sensitivity analyses). The authors also provide the explanation behind the selection of confounders, providing background references. Study size Figure 1 As in the first example, Figure 1 presents all people who were excluded at each stage and the remaining analytic sample size. Quantitative variables N/A The key outcome and explanatory variables in this study were binary. In the “statistical analysis” sub-section, it is mentioned that the “age” variable is included as a confounder, and it isn’t clear whether this was a continuous or a categorical variable. However, this is neither key outcome nor explanatory variable, so the level of detail is perhaps not required. Statistical methods The sub-sections titled “statistical analysis” and “sensitivity analysis” The authors provide details on the descriptive, inferential, missing data and sensitivity analyses, including the statistical software and packages. Other The sub-section titled “ethics approval” The ethics approval for the use of data source is stated briefly. 3.3 Significance of the methods section in population and public health research paper In population and public health, the methods section of the research paper should enable readers to assess the internal and external validity of the study. It should provide all the necessary information to understand in which ways the authors have made efforts to try to address their research question as accurately as possible. As Rothman et al. describes, generally the goal of epidemiologic research is to “obtain a valid and precise estimate of the frequency of a disease or of the effect of an exposure on the occurrence of a disease in the source population of the study” (Rothman 2008, 128–47). In addition, as the introduction section would have described the importance of the research question in relation to the population and public health, researchers often aim to generalize the study findings to the relevant population groups. By providing clear and adequate information about the target population and how the study sample was selected from the source population, the methods section allows the readers to assess the generalizability of the study findings. As such, a well-written methods section in a research paper in population and public health should contain necessary information about the analytical steps undertaken in the study, and sufficient description of the study design and target population to enable readers to understand what some of the potential sources of bias in the study are, and what measures were taken to minimize the bias. This allows the readers to interpret the internal and external validity of the study. A well-written methods section provides credibility and validity of the results and conclusions of the study. After reading the methods section, the readers should have an understanding of the dataset which is under consideration in the study, who the target population was, how the data was collected, and how the analytic data was created (who are included and excluded). Based on the analytic steps described in the methods section, the readers should also be able to understand how the results and conclusions in the next sections of the paper derive from the statistical analyses. Finally, the readers should be able to replicate the study if needed and reproduce the results if they had access to the data source. 3.4 Common pitfalls Common pitfalls in the methods section can largely arise from not reviewing the key elements of the methods section carefully and missing some of the elements in consequence. Missing crucial elements providing information on the potential sources of selection or information bias can result in losing the reviewers’ and editors’ confidence in the validity and credibility of the study findings. Another common problem is not providing any explanations regarding the variable selection (i.e. how the covariates were included or not included in the model). Be mindful about plagiarism and self-plagiarism, especially if you are using the same data source or similar methods from previously published work. 3.5 Tips As in the introduction section, excessive and unnecessary details are discouraged. Unless the focus of your paper is the methodological approach, only discuss enough details to enable reproducibility and to highlight the elements that are relevant for the interpretation of the results. We talked about presenting the research as a “story,” any detail that are unnecessary or redundant to understanding this story should be avoided. The methods section should also include a statement on the ethical approval or any other ethical considerations. It’s often a good idea to include a citation for the statistical test or method, if this is relatively unknown to the readers. This can also increase the credibility of the methods presented. Some journals focused on patient-oriented research encourage researchers to include any processes or efforts that were made to include patients or the community members during research. If patients or community members were involved in the study at any step, it can be a good idea to describe what their involvement was.
