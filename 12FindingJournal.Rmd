# Finding Suitable Journals


Once an article is written, the next step is to find a suitable journal and then format the journal according to the author guidelines. 

Authors can try to submit their title, abstract and keywords to try to identify journals in the following publisher specific search tools that may have matching interests. 

- [Elsevier](https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/)
- [Springer](https://journalsuggester.springer.com/)
- [Taylor and Francis](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/choosing-a-journal/journal-suggester/)
- [Wiley](https://journalfinder.wiley.com/search?type=match)

Alternatively, authors could use external search tools that aggregates journal information:

- [Jane](https://jane.biosemantics.org/) (uses information from PubMed)
- [Web of Science](https://mjl.clarivate.com/home)

There exists other similar resources that authors could consider checking:

- [edanz](https://www.edanz.com/journal-selector)
- [Open Journal Matcher](https://ojm.ocert.at/)
- [Journal Guide](https://www.journalguide.com/)
- [IEEE](https://publication-recommender.ieee.org/home)

## Refining the scope of your search {-}

- Authors should check carefully if the journal has a mandatory open access fee or article processing cost (APC). Often these fees can be very high. If authors do not have a source of funding for these fees, they should aim for subscription based journals.
- Other refinement criteria includes
  - Time to decision / publication (how long the journal takes to process the article)
  - CiteScore or Impact factor (IF) of the journal (IF is a measure of importance of a journal by calculating the number of times it's articles are cited)
  - Acceptance rate (among the articles that are submitted in the journal, how many of them are eventually accepted in the journal)
- Authors should be aware that there exists many [predatory journals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_publishing), and they should avoid choosing them.
